Data! A good analysis of some beautiful data will enable engineers to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be apparent through intuition alone.\nHaving this approach is incredibly helpful to narrow and isolate performance bottlenecks in systems and find areas for improvement.\nOnce you have a bucket of historical data, it gets much much more interesting and fun.
